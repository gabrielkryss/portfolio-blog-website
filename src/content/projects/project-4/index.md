### About

This is a simple visual studio console project that renders a maze explorer simulator on the terminal in first person using ASCII characters.

This projects was mainly for practicing and learning linear algebra applied to a project.

### Technologies Used

C++

### Learnings

- Applied simple linear algebra and vector math to implement ray casting, wall hit/edge detection and player movement.
- Learned how to render different ASCII characters based on ray depth.
- Learned about terminal screen buffers and how to map player 2D coordinate position onto a screen buffer with a first person perspective, updating over an infinite event loop.
