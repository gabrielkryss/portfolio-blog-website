I contributed to the development of a real-time editable procedural world generation VR application for Quest 2 and Quest 3. I improved content development workflows by building multiple proprietary tools. Additionally, I experimented with and documented software system architecture prototypes, successfully integrating them into production when viable.

Technologies involved: **Unity, C#, XR Interaction Toolkit, Quest 2, Quest 3, Firebase**
